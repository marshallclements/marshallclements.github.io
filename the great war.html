<h1>65 million years ago in a galaxy far far away</h1>
<p>A long time ago a huge influx of plantains were sent hurtling to earth by the aliens. Satan had been planning for this however.
He had bunches gathered by the millions. each bunch carrying 10 ripe sturdy bananas to fend off the starchy missiles on the way.
As the plantains rained onto the ground the dinos went into the earth to seek shelter.
The bananas fought back with great force zand kept the plantains at bay.
the plantains were refused access to the earths crust in order to keep the dinos safe and a treaty was formed to keep it that way.
    However not a day goes by without a plantain extremest trying to get at thoes dino buggers</p>
